# Genius
College project for the subject Data Structure.

The goal of this project was to be like the old game Genius, but with four numbers instead of the four colors. 

It's a memory game with 3 levels of difficulty. The game consists of a random sequence of original numbers (from 1 to 4) that
must be memorized by the player, and the player must repeat it. If the player put a sequence different from de original the game ends.
More correct sequences, more points the player accumulates. In the end of the game, it shows the top 5 rank of the last matches.
