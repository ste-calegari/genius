# Genius
College project for Data Structure class.

The goal of this project was to be like the old game Genius, but with four numbers instead of the four colors. 

It's a memory game with 3 levels of difficulty. The game consists of a random sequence of original numbers (from 1 to 4) that
must be memorized by the player, and the player must repeat it. If the player puts a different sequence from the original the game ends.
More correct sequences, more points the player accumulates. In the end of the game, it shows the top 5 rank of the last matches.
